Quickly Sorting some data

Are you sick of unsorted data? Do you see the array [2,1,5,7,3,9] and instantly fill up with rage? If so, this repo is for you.

In the code you will find Quicksorts written in the five most popular programming languasges; Python, JS, Java, C++ & C#. (Those are the ones I know)

The goal of this repo?

- See how syntax varies between programming languages, and see which is the most readable.
- Race the languages and see which is the fastest at carrying out a single task.

To run the code you will need to install NodeJS, Python, compilers for C#, C++ & your own Java VM. -> I used GPP, JavaC & Mono-Complete

Enjoy!
